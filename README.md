Welcome to my collection of personal projects! This repository contains a variety of projects built with C++ and Python, ranging from games to computer vision and networking applications.

## 🗂️ Projects Overview

### 🧨 C++: Defence Game
An interactive game where the goal is to intercept incoming missiles. You have 1 minute to stop as many missiles as possible.

### 🧍‍♂️ Python: AI Computer Vision Demo
An AI-driven application that collects patient information and performs pose estimation on a video from a camera.

> 📂 Path: `python/ai_cv_demo`

---

### 🎥 Python: Classic AI Computer Vision
Processes input videos for people detection and face bluring for privacy protection. Uses classical computer vision techniques.

> 📂 Path: `python/classic_cv`

### 🐍 Python: Stocks Analysis

Free, open-source data fetaching web application from serveral well-known stocks analysis websites. 
**Path:** `python/stocks_analysis`

---

### 🐍 Python: RAG (Document Retrieval + LLM)

A generic RAG pipeline that allows you to query local document collections (PDFs, text) with an LLM. It uses LangChain and a vector database (Chroma or FAISS) to retrieve context and feed it into a language model chat interface. Ideal for building Q&A assistants over custom document sets.  
**Path:** `python/rag`

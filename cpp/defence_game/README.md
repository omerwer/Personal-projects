## 🎮 Quick Start

```bash
# From repository root
cd cpp/defence_game      # <- if you cloned the whole Personal‑projects repo

./build.sh               # 1) auto‑generates include/config.hpp
                         # 2) compiles all sources into ./start_playing

# Run with default cannon settings
./start_playing

# …or tweak them:
./start_playing -firepower=35 -angle=30

Prerequisites
• g++ with C++17 and POSIX threads (-lpthread)
• A terminal that supports ANSI escape codes (Linux, macOS, or Windows 10+)


🕹️ Gameplay
A Pitcher on the right launches “plates” every ~2 seconds.

Press Enter to fire a rocket from the Cannon on the left.

The rocket’s arc depends on angle and firepower.

A hit occurs if the rocket intersects a plate’s bounding box.

Game lasts 60 seconds. Stats are shown at the end:

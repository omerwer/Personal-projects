# 🧠 Personal Projects by Omer Wertheimer

Welcome to my collection of personal projects! This repository contains a variety of projects built with C++ and Python, ranging from games to computer vision and networking applications.

## 🗂️ Projects Overview

### 🧨 C++: Defence Game
A fast-paced interactive game where the goal is to **intercept incoming missiles** by selecting the correct firing angle and power. You have **1 minute** to stop as many missiles as possible by pressing the **Enter** key to fire. Perfect for testing reflexes and basic trajectory estimation!

### 💬 Python: Client-Server Messaging App
A simple messaging application using Python's socket programming (or MQTT if applicable), allowing multiple clients to communicate with a server and with each other. Supports features like online status checks, file transfer, and graceful disconnection with signal handling.

### 🧍‍♂️ Python: AI Computer Vision Demo
An AI-driven application that collects **patient information** and performs **pose estimation** using state-of-the-art models. Ideal for research or healthcare-oriented use cases where body posture analysis is required.

### 🎥 Python: Classic AI Computer Vision
Processes input videos to **detect people** and **blur their faces** for privacy protection. Uses classical computer vision techniques (OpenCV, Haar cascades, etc.)—a useful utility for anonymizing videos in research or public datasets.

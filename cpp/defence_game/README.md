# Iron‑Dome Defence Game (terminal C++17 mini‑game)

Intercept incoming “missiles” with defensive "rockets"

---

## 🎮 Quick Start

```bash
# From repository root
cd cpp/defence_game

./build.sh               # 1) auto‑generates include/config.hpp
                         # 2) compiles all sources into ./start_playing

# Run with default cannon settings
./start_playing [-firepower=POWER] [-angle=ANGLE]

Prerequisites
• g++ with C++17 and POSIX threads (-lpthread)
• A terminal that supports ANSI escape codes (Linux, macOS, or Windows 10+)


🕹️ Gameplay
A Pitcher on the right launches “missiles” every ~2 seconds.
Press Enter to fire a rocket from the Cannon on the left.
The rocket’s arc depends on angle and firepower.
A hit occurs if the rocket intersects a plate’s bounding box.
Game lasts 60 seconds. Stats are shown at the end:

Total shots fired
Plates hit
Accuracy %
